#Terraform Installation STEPS

## On Ubuntu 18.04

1. Install unzip
  sudo apt-get install unzip

2. Download latest version of the terraform ** You can replace with the lastest release from:  https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
 wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.11.13/terraform_0.11.13_linux_amd64.zip

3. Extract the downloaded file archive
  unzip terraform_0.11.13_linux_amd64.zip

4. Move the executable into a directory searched for executables
  sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/

5. Run it

## ON Windows

1. Download terraform for windows from: https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
  Note: Terraform is packaged as a zip archive, so after downloading Terraform, unzip the package. Terraform runs as a single binary named terraform. 
  Any other files in the package can be safely removed and Terraform will still function
2. Copy files from the zip to “c:\terraform” for example. That’s our terraform PATH.
3. The final step is to make sure that the terraform binary is available on the PATH.
  a) Type Variables in search or you can open from Control panel--> System--> Advance System Settings--> Advanced Tab
  b) Click Environment Variables. 
  c) n the section System Variables, find the PATH environment variable and select it. Click Edit. If the PATH environment variable does not exist, click New.
  d) In the Edit System Variable (or New System Variable) window, append at the end of the PATH environment variable the value of terraform path ex.”c:\terraform;” .
  e) Click OK and close all remaining windows.
4. Open the command prompt and run terraform. eg: terraform --version
